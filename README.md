# Tinder Autopilot

The Tinder Autopilot is a interesting attempt to make a Tinder Bot with Auto Swiping and Bot Chat. 

We started this project on a Hackathon - [DO!Hack 2018](https://2018.dohack.io/) - in Dortmund, Germany. During the event we had 24 hours to develop a project in a team.

# Current state
After the Hackathon we had a Bot that swipes for you based on Tags you give the bot. We also have a nice User Interface :D

# Missing Features
  - Auto Swiping based on the picture. (implementation of Eigenfaces or similar)
  - Integrate a Chatbot
  - Possibility to create own chat profiles / add own chat phrases.
